# COVID_SQL_Practice
This project is intended to demonstrate SQL coding capabilities of its author, through querying publicly available datasets and creating basic data visualizations.   

This respository contains .sql code files; a set of data files sourced from CDC's COVID-19 Public Datasets, US Census Bureau, and National Center for Health Statistics that constitute a relational database hosted locally; output data files from running .sql queries on the aforementioned local database; data visualizations of output data files in Microsoft PowerPoint & Excel.
